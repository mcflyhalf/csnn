# CSNN

Implement image classifier for MNIST dataset without using any Neural Network library.

## Getting Started

To start, on your terminal, cd to the place where you want the project to live then:
'''
git clone https://github.com/mcflyhalf/csnn
virtualenv --PYTHON=python3 csnn
cd csnn
source bin/activate
pip3 install numpy
cd csnn
wget http://deeplearning.net/data/mnist/mnist.pkl.gz
'''
In case you are curious, what you just did was to:
1. Download the git repository and files
1. Create a virtual environment to run python3
1. Activated your virtual environment (steps 3 and 4)
1. Installed numpy (whihc is the only 3rd party library we will use)
1. Downloaded the mnist dataset

Now open csnn/csnn and open all the python files in there in your favourite editor. Do not close your terminal
